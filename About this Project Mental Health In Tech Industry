Mental health is often overlooked in the fast paced world of technology, where long hours, tight deadlines and sedentary work can silently impact well-being. This project aims to bring awareness and provide support through data driven insights.
We built a machine learning model integrated with a Streamlit web app that helps users better understand their mental health. The app collects information about work environment, lifestyle habits and family history of mental health conditions. Based on these responses, the model predicts the user’s mental health status and suggests practical steps to improve or maintain it.
